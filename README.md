# Medical Data Research Project-01--EEG-Data

Problem: Tinnitus is a subjective symptom or feeling; there is still a lack of an objective method to diagnose and detect tinnitus symptoms.

What we can do: This project aims to use machine learning algorithms to classify tinnitus data, select the best classifier, and apply it in the clinical detection of tinnitus. This study would help doctors improve the efficiency of tinnitus detection so that tinnitus patients could get faster and more effective treatment in the later stages.

I utilized Python to preprocess raw data, including data cleaning and integration. I prepared the training and testing datasets and selected and extracted features. To perform exploratory data analysis on the selected features, I employed Julia. Machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest, were implemented using Julia to design and implement algorithmic models. I conducted algorithm model optimization, parameter selection, model evaluation, and data classification prediction.
