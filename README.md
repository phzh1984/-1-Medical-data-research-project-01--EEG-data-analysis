Background

Concepts: Tinnitus is a common disease in life. It is a hearing disorder that involves the perception of sound without an external source of sound.

Influence: It can cause distress, anxiety, and depression in people. In recent years, the prevalence of tinnitus has gradually increased, becoming one of the most pressing public health problems.

Reason: Hearing loss due to exposure to loud sounds is the most common cause of tinnitus.

NZ situation: Up to 30% of people in New Zealand experience mild tinnitus at some point in their lives, and around 5% experience painful tinnitus.


Problem: Tinnitus is a subjective symptom or feeling; there is still a lack of an objective method to diagnose and detect tinnitus symptoms.

What we can do: This study aims to use machine learning algorithms to classify tinnitus data, select the best classifier, and apply it in the clinical detection of tinnitus. This study would help doctors improve the efficiency of tinnitus detection so that tinnitus patients could get faster and more effective treatment in the later stages.
